## 1. Welcome to Join Our Diffcoder Experiment!

Qualitative analysis (QA) is a widely used approach in human-computer interaction and social computing research. One of the critical processes in QA is coding, which involves identifying patterns and insights in qualitative data. However, this process heavily relies on human labor, making it time-consuming and inefficient. 

Our project aims to improve the efficiency of the coding process in qualitative analysis by providing an AI-based collaboration tool for coders. This tool streamlines the coding process and saves time for QA researchers, enabling them to better analyze qualitative data and make new discoveries.


## 2. A 30-minute Introduction to Qualitative Analysis

Please watch the following video to get an understanding of how to do qualitative analysis.

## 3. Experiment Process

### 1) Task Introduction:

You are a team of researchers analyzing the reviews of a newly launched restaurant in town. The research question is to identify the factors that influence customer satisfaction. 

Your task is to code the reviews to obtain meaningful insights. Here's an example:

> "The food was delicious, but the service was terrible. The waiter was rude and inattentive."

- A reasonable way to **code** this sentence could be *Service Quality* or *Food Quality*.


### 2) Platforms used:

- [**Atlas.ti web**](https://atlasti.com/): A powerful software tool for collaborative qualitative data analysis that allows us to manage, code, and analyze textual, graphical, and audio-visual data.
- [**Google Docs**](https://www.google.com/docs/about/): A cloud-based document editor that allows us to easily collect and organize data from multiple sources and share it with collaborators.
- **Our Diffcoder platform (with AI supported)**: A web-based platform for qualitative data analysis with AI support that helps us to analyze data quickly and efficiently by identifying patterns and themes. 

### 3) Study Instruction:

For each platform, you will experience the following steps:
1. Mark up the qualitative data individually. (~10 mins).
2. Discuss the codes you have found, and create a codebook (~10 mins)
3. Fill up the survey (~3 minutes).

4. Answer the following questions (~5 minutes):
- Can Diffcoder support qualitative coders conduct a collaborative qualitative analysis process?
- How does Diffcoder compare to currently available tools like Google docs and MaxQDA?
- Does Diffcoder provide value over just doing collaborative qualitative analysis?
- How can the design of Diffcoder be improved?
