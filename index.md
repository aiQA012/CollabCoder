# 1. Welcome to Join Our Diffcoder Experiment!

Qualitative analysis (QA) is a widely used approach in human-computer interaction and social computing research. One of the critical processes in QA is coding, which involves identifying patterns and insights in qualitative data. However, this process heavily relies on human labor, making it time-consuming and inefficient. 

Our project aims to improve the efficiency of the coding process in qualitative analysis by providing an AI-based collaboration tool for coders. This tool streamlines the coding process and saves time for QA researchers, enabling them to better analyze qualitative data and make new discoveries.

# 3. Experiment Process

## 1) Task Introduction

You are a pair of researchers who are trying to perform qualitative analysis on interview transcripts of students undergoing a preparatory mock interview. The research question is to find general qualities of candidates (include good and bad ones). 

Your task is to code the sentences so that we may obtain a meaningful analysis of the transcripts. Here's an example. If we were to analyse meeting transcripts, a likely thing to be said during a meeting might be:

> "Ok, can Alice please follow up with Bob on the designs".

- A reasonable way to **code** this sentence could be *Action Items*.
- A succinct **subcode** or **description** could be "A person was asked to follow up on a task".
- This sentence would then be added as one of the **examples** of *Action Items* code.

## 2) Try the App!

Here you can try traditional [etherpad](https://rich.etherpad.com/). For the control experiment group, we will use this app to do qualitative analysis. In our experiment group, we will use an AI assisted tool to provide suggestions for your coding process! You will be assigned to experiment group or control group randomly.

For experiment group, AIcoder will be displayed to you during the experiment due to SUTD VPN restriction. AIcoder is a tool that enables you and your partner do coding using the same AI model. In the coding process, AIcoder powered by AI models will provide suggestions in a real-time based on your and your partner's codes history. 
- add code
- edit code
- delete code
- confidence level

## 3) Study Instruction

<!-- ### ExB:
**Creating the Codebook**

1. Mark up the first two interview transcripts individually. (~10-20 mins).
2. Discuss the codes you have found, and create one codebook (combining all the codes/subcodes from two materials) like the following (~30 mins):

**Coding using the Codebook**

3. Mark up the remaining one material individually (~10 minutes).
4. Fill up the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1E5ng5UotxJM_UkwdRDILn7qNA8xvFCCUnl_8dpaiVPk/edit) (~3 minutes).
5. Answer the following questions (~5 minutes):
   - During the labeling process, what are the difficulties when you label individually? 
   - What are the difficulties when collaborating with each other?
   - How do you think AIcoder deal with these difficulties between each other?
   - How do you feel when there is a code in the code list that you didn't add?
   - How do you feel like the confidence level?
   - Did AI help you deal with the conflicts between each other?
   - Do you use the AIcoder frequently? Why?
   - Do you feel that AIcoder helps you improve your coding efficiency and collaboration efficiency?
   - Do you feel it becomes faster after codebook forming, how? -->

<!-- ### ExC:

**Creating the Codebook**

1. The first coder marks up the first two interview transcripts individually (with ai model training), another coder can take a rest. (~10-15 mins).
2. The second coder marks up the two interview transcripts individually (with the same ai model training), another coder can take a rest. (~10-15 mins).
3. Discuss the codes you have found, and create one codebook (combining all the codes/subcodes from two materials) like the following (~30-40 mins):
